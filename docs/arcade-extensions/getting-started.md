# Extensions

Extensions are a powerful tool allowing you to store additional data for existing
Minecraft classes without the need to use your own mixins and duck interfaces.

The extension api is built on-top of the events api to register extensions.

## Adding to Dependencies

The extensions module depends on some other arcade modules; it's recommended that you
include all of these.

```kts
repositories {
    maven("https://maven.casualchampionships.net/snapshots")
}

dependencies {
    include(implementation("net.casualchampionships:arcade-extensions:0.11.0-beta.3+26.2")!!)

    include(implementation("net.casualchampionships:arcade-event-registry:0.11.0-beta.3+26.2")!!)
    include(implementation("net.casualchampionships:arcade-events-server:0.11.0-beta.3+26.2")!!)
    include(implementation("net.casualchampionships:arcade-utils:0.11.0-beta.3+26.2")!!)
}
```
